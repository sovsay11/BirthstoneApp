<!--About The Project-->
## About The Project
This is a C# Xamarin app that takes in a provided birth month and then displays the birthstone associated with that birth month.

### Built With
<ul>
  <li>C#</li>
  <li>Xamarin</li>
  <li>.NET</li>
  <li>Visual Studio</li>
</ul>

## Getting Started
IMO, the most straightforward way to get a local copy of this set up is to have VS already installed on your machine. Download a zipped copy of this code by going to the "<> Code" tab and expanding the green code button near the top right. Then press "Download Zip".

Once that is done, unzip the folder and open the project in VS by launching the solution file.

### Prerequisites
<ul>
  <li>
    Install <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">Visual Studio<a> (any version will work)
  </li>
  <li>A mobile device running Android (tablet, phone, etc.)
</ul>

### Installation
If you want to clone this repository for future use instead of downloading the zipped folder, you can do so by running the following command(s) in Git:

```sh
https://github.com/sovsay11/BirthstoneApp.git
```
    

## Usage
This app was created to showcase various features of Xamarin.Forms in a mobile app environment. Specifically, this app demonstrates the use of dictionaries, pickers, and C# to create a birthstone retriever.
